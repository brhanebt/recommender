No.	Strategy	Description
1	Baseline	Theme and Space treated as keywords
2
	Baseline + Spatial Search (Area of Overlap)	Theme treated as keyword while Space is geocoded for spatial search either using area of overlap or hausdorff distance. 
	Baseline + Spatial Search (Hausdorff)	
3	WordNet Expansion + Spatial Search (Area of Overlap)	Query expansion using wordnet is performed on theme and geocoding is performed on the space for spatial search either using area of overlap or hausdorff distance
	WordNet Expansion + Spatial Search (Hausdorff)	
4
	ConceptNet Expansion + Spatial Search (Area of Overlap)	Query expansion using ConceptNet is performed on theme and geocoding is performed on space keyword for spatial search either using area of overlap or hausdorff distance
