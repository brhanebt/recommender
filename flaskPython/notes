A critical aspect of query expansion based on external resources
is the coverage of the latter. An external resource should cover as
much as possible all the aspects and meanings of the query terms.
In this study, we choose to use ConceptNet [22], which is one of
the largest common-sense knowledge base that covers semantic
relationships between real-world concepts. It has been proven to
be an effective resource that could help improve retrieval
performance, especially for difficult queries [13][14][15][16].



The Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) [4] method is a representative implicit SRD method. It attempts to select documents by maximizing relevance and
reducing redundancy to higher ranked documents. Several studies
extended MMR [20][1] and applied it in different domains
[5]0[11]. In contrast, an explicit SRD approach attempts to cover
as much as possible the different subtopics of the query. A
representative method is xQuAD (explicit Query Aspect
Diversification framework) 0[21]. Recently, Vargas et al. [23]
observed that the retrieval results from which documents are
selected could be improved through query expansion. They
adopted xQuAD to select diverse expansion terms extracted from
documents related to different query aspects.

sources such as WordNet to increase the context information can be explored. We also intend to investigate whether complex techniques of word sense disambiguation (WSD) in WordNet are necessary for IR, under the existence of ConceptNet.

As commonsense knowledge is deeply
context-sensitive, the suitability of ConceptNet for QE is still uncertain. Note that
ConceptNet bears word sense ambiguities without differentiation
