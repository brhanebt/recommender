# A Systematic Comparison of Spatial Search Strategies in Open Government Datasets
Scripts for datasets and metadata harvesting, preprocessing, and prototype application to systematically compare spatial search strategies in open government data portals.

11 search strategies were chosen to examine four aspects of OGD retrieval more closely:

(i) The impact of space as extra dimension;
(ii) The impact of the spatial similarity function (i.e. area of overlap or Hausdorff distance)
(iii) The impact of the query expansion approach (i.e. synonyms only vs synonyms, hypernyms, and hyponyms)
(iv) The impact of the query expansion source (i.e. WordNet or ConceptNet).

Preliminary results can be found in:

comparison’, in 13th Workshop on Geographic Information Retrieval (GIR’19). Lyon, France.
